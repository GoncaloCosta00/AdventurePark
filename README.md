Project College project of Internet Applications 1
## Objectives
- With this project we want to make a static website totally functional with a theme at our choice.
- The project needs to be implemented using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and React.
- The layout of the page must focus on the use of percentages, and use the HTML5 semantic tags (nav, main, etc). The page must have some transitions/animations in links, buttons, etc. That allows to give a look and feel more appealing and easy to use.
## It must have some JavaScript animations:
1. On the home page of the website must be a slider of atleast three images. The image should change in accordance with a time interval.
2. The navigation menu should have submenus and use the capabilities of CSS and JavaScript to become more user friendly. Should have hover animations(changing text and background color).
3. It must have in all the webpage a clock using the computer clock.

## It must have some React animations:
1. A stateful component that includes a contact form
allowing the user to enter the name, reason for contact
(information, complaint, etc.), email, phone, and their
text. The form data should be stored in the
browser local storage;

## Requirements:
- Site layout must be implemented using containers
CSS (so-called wrappers), not tables;
- There must be a balance between the graphic and functional components,
that is, less graphically crafted websites should be more functionally sophisticated and feature rich sites
may be less graphically elaborated;
